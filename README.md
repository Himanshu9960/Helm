**Helm charts**
A Helm chart is a package that contains all the necessary resources to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes YAML configuration files for deployments, services, secrets, and config maps that define the desired state of your application.

A Helm chart packages together YAML files and templates that can be used to generate additional configuration files based on parametrized values. This allows you to customize configuration files to suit different environments and to create reusable configurations for use across multiple deployments. Additionally, each Helm chart can be versioned and managed independently, making it easy to maintain multiple versions of an application with different configurations.
